# recoverVec

Experiment: given the distance matrix `m2` of size NxN and the dimension D, 
is it possible to recover N vectors of dimension D which yield it? 

This may have been what I had in mind, perhaps.

The distance matrix imposes N·(N-1)/2 conditions. The vectors have N·D
dofs. So  it should be roughly possible if D>(N-1)/2 .
